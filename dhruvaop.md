# Object Detection Drone

## Summary

The goal of this project is to develop an 
object detection drone that can autonomously 
navigate and locate specific objects in an environment. 
The drone will be equipped with a camera and a machine learning 
model to detect and classify objects, and a control system to navigate 
and move towards the objects of interest.

## Plan

1. Order materials, then wait for arrival.
2. Assebmle the body of drone.
3. Install Batteries and motors.
4. Setting up the Simonk 30A 2-3s Brushless ESC
5. Boot, and configure KK2.1.5 Flight Controller Board.
6. Checking up the connection and rotation of the wings.
7. Experiment the first flight.
